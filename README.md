#Jetpack Gem Hunt

This is a game about making a living. You are from the future and a time traveling trip goes wrong. 
You find your self in the gold rush days near an old mine with nothing but an old prospector to help 
you out. If you bring him things from the mine he will help you survive. The mine isnâ€™t always easy. 
You can get lost, there are heavy things in your way, but if you work hard you will be rewarded.
